# Changelog

All notable changes to zencodec are documented here.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-03-25

### Added

- `GainMapSource` — raw gain map data extracted from container (pre-decode).
  Carries raw encoded bitstream + format + ISO 21496-1 metadata + recursion
  depth counter for safe nested decode. Accessible via
  `zencodec::gainmap::GainMapSource`.
- `DecodedGainMap` — decoded gain map pixels + metadata (post-decode).
  Cross-codec normalized type. Accessible via
  `zencodec::gainmap::DecodedGainMap`.
- Both types are `#[non_exhaustive]` with `new()` constructors.

### Changed

- Documented supplement decode convention: detection is always cheap
  (container metadata), pixel decode is opt-in. `ImageInfo.supplements`
  flags describe what's available, not what's decoded.
- Updated `docs/spec.md` with three-layer decode output model
  (ImageInfo, SourceEncodingDetails, Extensions type-map) and
  supplement access conventions.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-03-25

### Added

- `ImageInfo.is_progressive` field — true for progressive JPEG (SOF2),
  interlaced PNG (Adam7), interlaced GIF. Detectable from headers during
  cheap probe.
- `ImageInfo.with_progressive()` builder method.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-03-24

### Changed

- Drop unnecessary `imgref` feature from zenpixels dependency.
- Add magic byte detection audit example.
